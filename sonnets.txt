Sonnet 18
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

Sonnet 19
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetest,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I, poor wretch, made stupid by thy might,
Do prize thy minutes and do count them twice.
Thou art thy father's son and shouldst be twice
As fair as he: thy mother was my glass
And thou her son, didst never see thy face.

Sonnet 20
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted,
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
A woman's gentle heart, the livery light
That serves to turn thy black smoke by consent,
Is thine, whose deep compound√®d mystery
Teems in thy bosom and thy crystal eyes,
Both parts of thee, by every artist praised,
Yet not for those, which, thou thyself well know'st,
The world to thee doth owe; nor is that fame
Of which thy chameleon nature is the pride,
Nor that false red which thy cheeks daily gain,
Nor that right gait by which thou turnest mine eyes.
But those same eyes, thy tongue, and everything
That makes thee fair, all thy eternal parts,
Wherein thou movest times' hard-hearted stone,
And heaven, and men, to worship thee, are those
For which in thee I am no less in love
Than when I first saw that which I have now.

Sonnet 29
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

Sonnet 30
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear heart's grasp.
For on my table and against the fire
Many a day I kept the watch of night,
Counting the clock's almanac's tedious breath,
This time of year thou, fairy time, art here;
For summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
